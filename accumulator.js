/*Create new Accumulator

Create a constructor function Accumulator(startingValue).

Object that it creates should:

Store the “current value” in the property value. The starting value is set to the argument of the constructor startingValue.
The read() method should use prompt to read a new number and add it to value.
In other words, the value property is the sum of all user-entered values with the initial value startingValue.
